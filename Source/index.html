                <p><strong>The Landon Hotel - London</strong> was recently renovated, and we considered the impact on
                    the earth the entire way. From green building materials, to solar power, to energy-friendly lighting
                    and appliances throughout the hotel - we’re saving energy in every socket, outlet, and switch. We’ve
                    also initiated a recycling and composting program that reduces the load to local landfills, while
                    providing valuable raw material for use in new products, or in the case of compost, for use in local
                    gardens and landscapes.</p>

                    our rooms for the notable public squares and circuses around which the West End is laid&nbsp;out.
