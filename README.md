One of the best free, cross-platform code editors now works right within your browser. With Visual Studio Code for the Web, you can work on local files just as you would with a native app, and work on remote repositories without having to install anything on your computer. In this short course, Joe Marini takes a look at some of the key differences between the web and desktop versions, such as support for different programming languages and how extensions work in the web version. If youâ€™re familiar with Visual Studio Code and are considering using Visual Studio Code for the Web, this is the course for you.

The repository contains sample code for a fictional web site named The Landon Hotel to demonstrate editing code in Visual Studio Code for the Web.

## Installing
1. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
